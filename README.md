# C - Binary Trees
This repository focus on Binary Trees Data Structures. Each file is a solution of the implementation of the same.

## Learning Objectives
* Understading Binary Trees and its types
* Differentiating between Binary Trees and Search Binary Trees
* Familiarizing the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree


## Actions
* Creating a binary tree node
* Adding branches to a node
* Deleting nodes
* Checking whether a node is a leaf, a root
* Trasversal methods
* Knowing the family tree

## How to run
* `clone` the repository by clicking on the `code` green button
* Install `gcc`to be able to run on your terminal
* Create a sample code to test the files
* Create an executable by following the sample(change the `<sample>` with the real filenames). `gcc <filename.c> <main_sample.c> -o main`
* Run the executable created: `./main`
